## OS X 'Recent Files' integration

When you start NyaoVim, NyaoVim's application icon will appear in your OS X dock.  As other general OS X applications, 'Recent Files' item is available as dock menu.  (Please right click on an icon in dock.)
If you start to edit some file in NyaoVim (e.g. `:edit some-file`), NyaoVim registers it as 'recent file' and enable quick access with 'Recent Files' item in dock.

## OS X 'Current File' in title bar integration

When a file icon is shown just left of title in title bar, you can select a file to edit via the icon.  Please try clicking the icon with command key (Cmd + LeftClick) then you will see the pull-down menu to select a directory.  After selecting directory, you can select a file in the directory to start editing.
